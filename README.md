# Author: Tridib Banik, Software Engineering Level II, McMaster University.

_This is a baby names utility named bn that works with the freely available data for U.S. baby names found at
https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html._

_The bn utility allows users to search for the rankings of baby names from the late 1800s to today._

_A CI pipeline is configured with a testing script that runs on every push._

_The bn utility is programmed entirely in Bash using standard input and output, pipes and filters, regular expressions, and the grep utility._
